## Challenge 30: Hash Table Implementation
Hash Table Implementation

### Challenge
Implement a Hashtable that add, gets, contains and hashes.


### Approach & Efficiency
- hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.
- add: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
- get: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
- contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
