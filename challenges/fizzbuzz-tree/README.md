## Challenge 16: FizzBuzz
Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a tree while traversing through it. Change the values of each of the nodes dependent on the current node’s value

## Challenge Description
- Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a tree as an argument.

- Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine weather or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both, and change the value of each of the nodes:
  - If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
  - If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
  - If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”

- Return the tree with its new values.

- For explicitly-typed languages: Ensure your node values are of type Object, to hold either strings or integers.

## Approach & Efficiency
I wrote a function named fizzBuzzTree that take a tree as an argument.  Then determined if the value of each node was divisible by 3, 5 or both and changed the value of each node to fizz, buzz, or fizzbuzz accordingly.
